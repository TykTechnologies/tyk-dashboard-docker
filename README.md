Official Tyk Dashboard Docker Build
===================================

This container only contains the Tyk Dashboard, the Tyk Gateway is provided as a separate container and needs to be set up and running (with the Dashboard enabled) before it will work with this container.

The following ports are required to be open:

For Redis: 6379
For MongoDB: 27017

Quickstart
----------

1. Ensure you have set up the Redis, MongoDB and Tyk Gateway containers

2. Set up the docker instance IP as the Dashboard hostname (in your `/etc/hosts` file or as a DNS):

    127.0.0.1 dashboard.tyk.docker

3. Run the Dashboard

	`docker run -d --name tyk_dashboard -p 3000:3000 --link tyk_redis:redis --link tyk_mongo:mongo--link tyk_gateway:tyk_gateway tykio/tyk-dashboard`

4. You should now be able to access your Dashboard at `http://dashboard.tyk.docker:3000/` (note for OSX users, replace 127.0.0.1 with whatever IP address your docker VM runs)

5. Enter your Dashboard License. Go to `http://dashboard.tyk.docker:3000/`. You will see a screen asking for a license, enter it in the section marked “**Already have a license?**” and click `Use this license`.

6. Grab the bootstrap script from our [tyk-dashboard github repo](https://github.com/TykTechnologies/tyk-analytics) and run:

    ./bootstrap.sh dashboard.tyk.docker

To use an external configuration files, use the `-v` option to mount
it over `/opt/tyk-dashboard/tyk_analytics.conf`
